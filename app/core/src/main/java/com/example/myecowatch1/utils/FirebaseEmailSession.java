/**
 * Owns the short-lived Firebase session used to send EcoWatch's emails.
 *
 * <p>Why a session exists at all: Firebase will not send a verification email
 * unless a user is signed in, and EcoWatch never signs anyone in. So the app
 * creates the Firebase user during registration purely so Firebase can deliver
 * and track that one email, and signs out immediately once the EcoWatch account
 * exists.
 *
 * <p>What this session is NOT, and the reason the architecture still holds
 * together:
 *
 *   - It is not an EcoWatch login. The app never asks Firebase whether a
 *     credential is valid. Sign-in to EcoWatch is username + password against
 *     Supabase, and the JWT from this backend is the only session EcoWatch has.
 *   - It grants no access to anything. The account it describes does not exist in
 *     Supabase until the backend confirms the address was verified, and the
 *     backend derives the uid itself from the token rather than trusting the app.
 *   - It is not long-lived. {@link #signOut()} runs as soon as the account is
 *     created, and also on any failure path, so a device is not left holding a
 *     Firebase session for a resident who is not mid-registration.
 *
 * <p>The session is therefore a delivery mechanism, not an authentication
 * authority.
